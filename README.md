## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

This program sets up signal handlers for SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, and SIGINT signals.
 
It uses the sigaction system call to register the handlers and enters an infinite
loop waiting for signals.
  
Global Variables:
 g_byte: A global pointer to a dynamically allocated memory used for signal handling.
Functions:
- main: The entry point of the server program. It initializes signal handlers and enters an infinite loop.
Signal Handlers:
- handler_sigusr: Function to handle SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.
- handler_sigint: Function to handle SIGINT signal.
Error Handling:
- print_error_and_exit: Function to print an error message and exit the program.

The client program converts the PID from a string to an integer, sets up a signal handler, and sends the message
to the server process using signals.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- Compile ther source files with make. Run the executable server, it will print its PID and wait for signals.
./server
- Then run the executable client. It takes two arguments: the PID of the server process and the message to be sent.
./client server_pid message


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
